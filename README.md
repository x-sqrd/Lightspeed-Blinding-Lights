# Lightspeed (Blinding Lights)


So this is where all the magic happens, we take our python code from the BlindingLights normal repo, and change it into this Xcode project, where it is created into an actual ios app!


## NOTE: Additional Suppourting Swift can be found as playgrounds in the Shad0w5472/swiftfund repository!!!
